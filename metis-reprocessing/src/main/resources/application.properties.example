#Possible values CLEAN, DEFAULT, REPROCESS_ALL_FAILED, POST_PROCESS, POST_CLEAN.
#DEFAULT for a normal operation of process and index.
#CLEAN mode is to be used to just clean the destination databases, it does no processing
#REPROCESS_ALL_FAILED will process only the failed records for a dataset even if it's not previously completely processed.
#POST_PROCESS mode is to be used after everything is final and the last step needs to be executed. Don't use this mode unless you know what you are doing.
#POST_CLEAN mode is to be used to just remove the destination temporary databases, it does no processing
